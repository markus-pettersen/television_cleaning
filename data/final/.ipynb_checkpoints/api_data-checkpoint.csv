Carbon bullets, guns incorporating cameras and mirror sights, vampire bites that can only be seen through ultraviolet light... these are all updates on popular vampire mythology.</p><p>The CIB is made up of the traditional stereotypes of vampire hunting: a priest (Fr Pearse Harman - Philip Quast), an ex-soldier (Vaughan Rice - Idris Elba), and a scientist – in this case a haematology specialist (Dr Angela March - Susannah Harker).

Thomas Jefferson,2025-02-17,,['History'],English,62.0,6.6,"<p>Thomas Jefferson is widely considered the patron saint of America's most sacred beliefs. He is the central figure in the story of American democracy and when he penned the Declaration of Independence nearly 250 years ago, he personally inspired a revolution of self-governance around the world. More so than John Adams, Alexander Hamilton or even Abraham Lincoln, it was Jefferson's ""revolution of ideas"" that laid the groundwork for America's founding and success. As our 3rd president, Jefferson doubled the size of the country and inspired a western expansion that turned a fledgling nation into an empire. Jefferson's image as an American deity would be almost perfect… were it not for slavery. Although his immeasurable contributions to American freedom and growth have been well documented, the complexities of his relationship with slavery, which include a decades-long sexual relationship with an enslaved woman and the children who came from it, have remained largely misrepresented in the popular American narrative. THOMAS JEFFERSON is a 6×60 premium documentary series and the first of its kind to take an objective and comprehensive approach to the truly remarkable and surprising story of an American icon.</p>",Running

His partner, Aki Seto, never thought she would become a parent, so the two are at first confused by this unexpected event. As a pregnant man, Kentaro will face the scrutiny of the company and society, and will shed light on the hardships experienced by pregnant women. Challenged by many problems associated with modern pregnancy and childbirth, the two will have to face reality and make the ultimate decision: to have a baby or not.</p>",Ended
